# Review of Core Competencies of Extreme Programming

This repo reviews the in-class instruction prior to the winter 2018 break.

## highlights

* review the exercises up to test-driving subsystems;

* refactor an `angular cli`-generated project to our fast unit test infrastructure;

* port the `unit testing angular` courseware on to our fast test infrastructure; and

* publish screencasts of live coding the above. 

## pedagogy

It's important to develop the physical muscle memory of the engineering practices.  
We strongly encourage you to type all the code from the exercises, illustrated git history 
and screen casts into a clean exercise branch to compare against the published solution.

* retrieve [your copy of this repository](https://classroom.github.com/a/a6Z7x8ga);

* review this repository's commit history in a git desktop client 
(recommended: [gitx](https://rowanj.github.io/gitx/));

* review the screencasts; 

* code along with the commit history and the screen casts as best you can.
